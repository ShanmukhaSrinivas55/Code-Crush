          <h1>PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</h1>
              <div class="main">
         <p>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, [citation needed] based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures r itself. The first major procedural programming languages appeared circa 1957–1964, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, PL/I and BASIC.[1] Pascal and C were published circa 1970–1972.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Computer processors provide hardware support for procedural programming through a stack register and instructions for calling procedures and returning from them. Hardware support for other types of programming is possible, but no attempt was commercially successful (for example Lisp machines or Java processors)</p>

         <p><span style="color:#52D273;font-weight:bold">ADVANTAGES OF PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING<br></span>
              1. Procedural Programming is excellent for general-purpose programming<br>
              2. The coded simplicity along with ease of implementation of compilers and interpreters<br>
              3. A large variety of books and online course material available on tested algorithms, making it easier to learn along the way<br>
              4. The source code is portable, therefore, it can be used to target a different CPU as well<br>
              5. The code can be reused in different parts of the program, without the need to copy it<br>
              6. Through Procedural Programming technique, the memory requirement also slashes<br>
              7. The program flow can be tracked easily<br></p>

            <p><span style="color:#E95065;font-weight:bold">DISADVANTAGES OF PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING<br></span>
              1. The program code is harder to write when Procedural Programming is employed.<br>
              2. The Procedural code is often not reusable, which may pose the need to recreate the code if is needed to use in another application.<br>
              3. Difficult to relate with real-world objects.<br>
              4. The importance is given to the operation rather than the data, which might pose issues in some data-sensitive cases.<br>
              5. The data is exposed to the whole program, making it not so much security friendly.<br></p>

                 <p><span style="color:#46BDDF;font-weight:bold">KEY FEATURES OF PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING<br></span>
                  1. Predefined functions: A predefined function is typically an instruction identified by a name. Usually, the predefined functions are built into higher-level programming languages, but they are derived from the library or the registry, rather than the program. One example of a pre-defined function is ‘charAt()’, which searches for a character position in a string.<br>
                    <br>
                  2. Local Variable: A local variable is a variable that is declared in the main structure of a method and is limited to the local scope it is given. The local variable can only be used in the method it is defined in, and if it were to be used outside the defined method, the code will cease to work.<br>
                    <br>
                  3. Global Variable: A global variable is a variable which is declared outside every other function defined in the code. Due to this, global variables can be used in all functions, unlike a local variable.<br>
                    <br>
                  4. Modularity: Modularity is when two dissimilar systems have two different tasks at hand but are grouped together to conclude a larger task first. Every group of systems then would have its own tasks finished one after the other until all tasks are complete.<br>
                    <br>
                  5. Parameter Passing: Parameter Passing is a mechanism used to pass parameters to functions, subroutines or procedures. Parameter Passing can be done through ‘pass by value’, ‘pass by reference’, ‘pass by result’, ‘pass by value-result’ and ‘pass by the name’.<br></p>
