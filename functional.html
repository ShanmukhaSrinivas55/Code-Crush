          <h1>Functional Programming Paradigms</h1>
              <div class="main">

<p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm in that programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments, so calling a function with the same value for an argument always produces the same result. This is in contrast to imperative programming where, in addition to a function's arguments, global program state can affect a function's resulting value. One of the key motivations for the development of functional programming is making a program easier to understand by eliminating changes in state that do not depend on function inputs which are called side effects.</p>
<br>
<p>functional programming has its origins in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate computability, the Entscheidungsproblem, function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus. Another well-known declarative programming paradigm, logic programming, is based on relations.</p>
<br>
<p>In contrast, imperative programming changes state with statements in the source code, the simplest example being assignment. Imperative programming has subroutines, but these are not mathematical functions. They can have side effects that may change a program's state, allowing for functions without return values. Because of this, they lack referential transparency, that is, the same language expression can result in different values at different times depending on the state of the executing program.</p>
<br>
<p>Functional programming languages have largely been emphasized in academia rather than industry settings. However, programming languages that support functional programming have been used in industry, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang, OCaml,Haskell, and F#. JavaScript, one of the world's most widely distributed languages, has the properties of a dynamically typed functional language, in addition to imperative and object-oriented paradigms. Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, like R in statistics,J, K and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery/XSLT for XML.Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, especially in not supporting mutable values.</p>
<br>
<p>Programming in a functional style can be accomplished in languages that are not specifically designed for functional programming, such as with Perl,[27] PHP,[28] C++11, and Kotlin.[29] A hybrid case is that of Scala[30] – it is frequently written in a functional style, but the presence of side effects and mutable state place it in a grey area between imperative and functional languages.</p>

     <div class="main2">
         <p><span style="color:#52D273;font-weight:bold">FIRST-CLASS AND HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS</span></p><br>
<p>Higher-order functions are functions that can either take other functions as arguments or return them as results. In calculus, an example of a higher-order function is the differential operator {\displaystyle d/dx} d/dx, which returns the derivative of a function {\displaystyle f} f.</p>
<br>
<p>Higher-order functions are closely related to first-class functions in that higher-order functions and first-class functions both allow functions as arguments and results of other functions. The distinction between the two is subtle: "higher-order" describes a mathematical concept of functions that operate on other functions, while "first-class" is a computer science term that describes programming language entities that have no restriction on their use (thus first-class functions can appear anywhere in the program that other first-class entities like numbers can, including as arguments to other functions and as their return values).</p>
<br>
<p>Higher-order functions enable partial application or currying, a technique that applies a function to its arguments one at a time, with each application returning a new function that accepts the next argument. This lets a programmer succinctly express, for example, the successor function as the addition operator partially applied to the natural number one.</p>
</div>
             <div class="main3">
              <p><span style="color:#E4556A;font-weight:bold">PURE FUNCTIONS</span></p><br>
<p>Pure functions (or expressions) have no side effects (memory or I/O). This means that pure functions have several useful properties, many of which can be used to optimize the code:</p>
<br>
<p>If the result of a pure expression is not used, it can be removed without affecting other expressions.</p>
<br>
<p>If a pure function is called with arguments that cause no side-effects, the result is constant with respect to that argument list (sometimes called referential transparency), i.e., calling the pure function again with the same arguments returns the same result. (This can enable caching optimizations such as memoization.)</p>
<br>
<p>If there is no data dependency between two pure expressions, their order can be reversed, or they can be performed in parallel and they cannot interfere with one another (in other terms, the evaluation of any pure expression is thread-safe).</p>
<br>
<p>If the entire language does not allow side-effects, then any evaluation strategy can be used; this gives the compiler freedom to reorder or combine the evaluation of expressions in a program (for example, using deforestation).</p>
